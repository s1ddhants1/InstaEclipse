/**
 * Crash guard for the carousel / realtime teardown race seen on Instagram 446+ and 447.0.0.39+.
 *
 * When a carousel's realtime media stream (and, downstream, the Analytics2 event pipeline) is torn
 * down — e.g. right after a download or copy-media action — IG's native
 * {@code TigonRepeatingForwardingRequestToken} / analytics processor can still submit a task to a
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} that has ALREADY shut down. The executor's
 * default {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy} then throws
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException}, which unwinds back through native JNI and
 * hard-crashes Instagram (every crash variant terminates at AbortPolicy.rejectedExecution). The task
 * can never run on a dead executor, so the only sane outcome is to drop it — exactly what a
 * DiscardPolicy would do — instead of crashing.
 *
 * This hook narrows to precisely that: it intercepts {@code AbortPolicy.rejectedExecution} and
 * swallows the rejection ONLY when the target executor is already shut down. A rejection on a live
 * executor (genuine queue-full backpressure) still throws normally, so nothing about normal
 * operation changes. The hook sits on the rejection path only (never a hot path) and is fully
 * try/catch-guarded.
